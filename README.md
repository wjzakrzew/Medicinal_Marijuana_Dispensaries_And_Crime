# Medicinal_Marijuana_Dispensaries_And_Crime
Publication on Medicinal Marijuana Dispensaries and Crime in Washington, DC.

## ABSTRACT
The legalization of medical marijuana remains a controversial policy. An
important dimension of marijuana legalization is the siting of dispensaries
and their influence on a surrounding community. Specifically,
dispensaries, if they engender criminogenic opportunities via changes
in routine activities, have the potential to increase crimes in the areas
surrounding medicinal marijuana dispensaries (MMDs). Using a quasiexperimental
design, we examine the relationship between MMDs and
crime using micro-spatial units in a novel location. Street level geocoded
crime data for violent and nonviolent crime patterns before and after the
opening of MMDâ€™s in Washington, D.C. Crime is analyzed with
100 m buffers around each dispensary and control location drawn from
propensity score matching. Differences between crime rates pre- and
postoperation are compared. With the exception of one location, crime
decreased or remained constant in geographical areas following the
opening of a dispensary. MMDs do not appear to have an immediate
criminogenic effect. Implications for future research regarding potential
confounding factors and data limitations are discussed.
